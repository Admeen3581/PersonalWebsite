I am a man of many interests and have multiple fun and engaging activities to do that allow me to see the light in life. Outside my skiing adventures and projects, you can find me mountain biking, catching views on views around America, or making social media content. I have been biking since the age of seven years old. I bike more than I walk at this rate. The adrenaline of going between the trees and down the hill is unmatched. I travel the United States with my family and try to gain the wide-ranging perspectives that American soil has to offer. I use my DJI Mini 4 Pro to get breathtaking shots of my journey to develop my ideas to fully-fleshed works of art.

Content creation is not just any activity for me, it is the centerpiece of my other interests. Compiling footage into dynamic 'hype' waterskiing videos or getting drone shots of me travelling is my way of sharing the essence of my endeavors. It also allows me to integrate my interests into my academic projects. If that means triple the amount of work then you can assume I will be having the time of my life doing that project!
