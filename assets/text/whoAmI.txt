I am Adam Long, a student attending Texas State University to receive a B.S. in Computer Science.

In my youth, I always tore things apart to figure out how they worked. Since then, curiosity has inspired me to push the limits of what is possible and technology allows me to dig deep into how things work. I am more immersed in technology than ever and strive to make a positive impact in the lives of others. Computer science helps me engage in technology to satisfy my curiosity.

Of course, I am not strictly a computer scientist. In my off time you can see me speeding through the water while waterskiing, or letting my creativity run with my personal woodworking and graphic design projects. Alongside achieving a strong academic performance I am a collegiate athlete for the Texas State University Waterski Team and try to lead them as their captain.
