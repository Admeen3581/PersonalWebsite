I am Adam Long, a student attending Texas State University to receive a B.S. in Computer Science.

In my youth, I always tore things apart to figure out how they worked. Since then, curiosity has inspired me to push the limits of what is possible and technology allows me to dig deep into how things work. I am more immersed in technology than ever and strive to make a positive impact in the lives of others. Computer science helps me engage in technology to satisfy my curiosity.

Of course, I am not strictly a computer scientist. In my off time you can see me leading my waterski team as captain, or letting my creativity run with my personal craftsmanship projects. Alongside achieving my life goals I try my best to just make the world a happier place one smile at a time.
