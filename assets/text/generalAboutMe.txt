I'm a Computer Science major at Texas State University.
My journey into the world of technology began out of sheer curiosity,
and I'm passionate about using it to make a positive impact. Whether I'm speeding through the water while waterskiing or immersing myself in personal projects,
like creating this website, I thrive on the excitement of hands-on experiences.
