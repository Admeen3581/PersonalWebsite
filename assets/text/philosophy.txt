For my career: I am passionate to use my current skills to work for someone to obtain more experience working with a team and to build a reputation as a hard-working and dedicated contributor. Exceeds in achieving great customer satisfaction while critically thinking to pay attention to the small details that matter. Focused on working efficiently to maximize resources and time in a professional environment.

For my mind: Life is a dynamic journey of curiosity and discovery. In a world that often emphasizes perfection, I choose to embrace the beauty of the inherent imperfections in life. I would much rather be memorable, curious, experimenting, and open-minded than focused on perfection every hour of every day. There will be opportunities dropped and doors opened, no matter what path is selected.

For my heart: I just aim to be the person that your dog thinks I am. Making everything fun along the way even when it's not supposed to be.
